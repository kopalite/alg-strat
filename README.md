# alg-strat
Strategy pattern enhanced with option to dynamically arrange strategies into configurable algorithm. The algorithm can be configured into flat list of prioritized and/or chained-by-id strategies. Configuration can be done externally (in file, db...) or in run-time (fluent API). External configuration comes very handy for rapid and crytical deployments when we are not sure about accurate algorithm structure, efficiency or correctness. It's a hybrid product of enhancing strategy pattern with elements of Chain of Responsibility pattern - resulting with simple and configurable workflow framework. You can build huge number of algorithm variations with very little code base.
