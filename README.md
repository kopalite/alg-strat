# alg-strat
Strategy pattern enhanced with option to dynamically arrange strategies into configurable algorithm. The algorithm can be configured into flat list of prioritized and/or chained-by-id strategies. Configuration can be done externally (in file, db...) or in run-time (fluent API). External configuration comes very handy for rapid and crytical deployments when we are not sure about accurate algorithm structure, efficiency or correctness. By using configuration we achieve similar behavior as specification compositions in specificaiton pattern - having the composition been done on-the-fly with custom result type.
