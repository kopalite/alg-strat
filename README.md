# alg-strat
Strategy pattern enhanced with option to dynamically arrange strategies into configurable algorithm. Basic usage: an algorithm can be configured into flat list of prioritized strategies. Advanced usage: an algorithm can be configured into sophisticated execution tree based on wiring up strategies between each-other. Configuration can be done in design-time (in file, db...) or in run-time (fluent API)
